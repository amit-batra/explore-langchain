# Explore LangChain

This repository contains a set of independent Python apps built using LangChain to perform some simple actions with Large Language Models. Each sub-directory contains an independent project that can be tried out in isolation. To set up your local environment for running these apps, consult the `README.md` inside the corresponding sub-directory.
